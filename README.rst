**Grammar designer application which exports AMD/CommonJS/browser-compatible garbage
text generators.**

Baba is a modern Javascript-based grammar designer for garbage text generators,
inspired by the `Dada Engine <http://dev.null.org/dadaengine/>`_. It runs in the
browser and allows you to easily design your very own garbage text generator.

Baba exports compressed garbage text generator scripts which can be run in the
browser or on the command line (with node.js).

TODO:

Create variable references

Create toggle button for padding elements with whitespace!

Create toggle button for optional phrases

Export as C code! - this could be difficult with transforms, maybe limit to regex-based transforms.

Add context menu to preview, to be able to directly change words, transforms, etc.

IDEAS:

Wine bottle generator (with taste notes)
Snobbery generator (cigars, coffee, whiskey, etc)
